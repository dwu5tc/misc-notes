emberjs notes

MVC 
- separates and isolates responsibilities
- user interacts with controller 
- controller manipulates data in model
- model updates view layer 
- view displayed to user

	ember new <app-name> <options>

templates

	{{outlet}}

- if no id provided, ember will auto-generate one

	tagName="_____" 
		- instruct ember to use a specific tag

- helpers for tag generation and logic
	- debugger: stop processing to enter debugger 
	- each: loop [!!!]
	- if: conditional
	- input: create HTML input
	- link-to: create HTML anchor

		{{#link-to "<route-name>" <object-to-view>}}
	
	- log: console log
	- textarea: create HTML textarea
	- unless: conditional
- outermost template: application temp

routes
- router (manages state) --> routers --> template (defines HTML)
- responsible for collecting data and rendering proper templates

	ember generate route <route-name>

- hooks
	- activate: triggered when navigation enters route
	- deactivate: triggered when navigation leaves route 
	- model: returns model data to use in route and template 
	- redirect: send user to another route 

models and services
- service: long-living objects (singletons) that can be accessed throughout app
	- centralized logging
	- user sessions
	- websocket management
	- data repositories

	ember generate service <service-name>

- models: represent underlying (sometimes persisted) data of the app

actions
- map generic DOM events to specific app activities and functions
- e.g
	- click --> expandArticle
	- keypup --> autoCompleteSearch
	- submit --> createOrder
- by default, actions prevent browser default activity (preventDefault)

	on="click" 
		- the default trigger

computer properties
- about 30 predefined computed property macros
- e.g sum, mapBy, etc.

components
- reusable way to combine a template with action handling and behavior
- used for
	- charts
	- tabs
	- tree widgets
	- buttons with confirmations
	- data range selectors
	- wrap libraries and services

	ember generate component <component-name>
