course covers express 4.9.x

intro
- express extends node http objects
- request inherits from http.IncomingMessage
- response inherits from http.ServerResponse

middleware
- functions executed sequentially that access request and response
- e.g validation, authentication, data parsing
- express app = essentially a stack of MW running one after another
	- requests start at the first MW and work their way down the stack

		- client --> 

		app.use(function(req,res, next) { // middleware A (beginning of express???)
			...
			next(); 
		});
		
		--> (moves to the next middleware in the stack)
		
		...next(); // middleware B
		
		-->
		
		...next(); // middleware C
		
		--> --> -->
		
		app.use(function(req, res, next) { // middleware N completes the request
			...
			response.send('done');
		});

		--> client
- node module system follows the commonjs specification

- parsing form data requires middleware not shipped with express
