- directives for binding behavior

- wrap JS in closure = good habit

- directives: HTML annotations that trigger JS behaviors
- modules: where our app components live
- controllers: where we add app behaviour
- expression: how values get displayed within the page

- angular has many filters
	- time
	- uppercase & lowercase
	- currency
	- limitTo
	- orderBy

- ng-model binds the form element val to the prop

- custom-directives
	- element directives for UI widgets 
	- attribute directives for mixin behaviors 
		e.g <h3 product-title></h3>

		app.directive('productTitle', function() {
			...
			restrict: 'A',
			...
		});

- organizing modules:
	- app.js = top-level module attached via ng-app
	- products.js = all the functionality for products and ONLY products
	


- dont really understand product specs
