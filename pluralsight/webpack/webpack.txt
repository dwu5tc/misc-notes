INTRODUCTION
--------------------

- why are builds necessary?
	- combining files
	- minifying files
	- maintaining file order
	- transpilation
	- linting
- other solutions
	- server-side tools: ASP.NET, rails, etc
	- task runners: grunt, gulp, etc
- webpack = specialized task runner
	- processing input files and output files
	- utilizes components called loaders
	- can set up transpilation --> concatentation --> minification
	- can also combine CSS into JS (less common with task runners)
- webpack conventions
	- use npm not bower
	- use module system: amd, commonjs, es6 modules

- module systems
	- express dependencies between modules (generally files in JS)

	- commonjs
		var bands = require('./Bands'); // requires path
		var Backbone = require('Backbone'); // no path because installed with npm
