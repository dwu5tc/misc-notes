- object relational database management system
- key features
	- sql:2011 standard
	- ACID compliant
	- indexes
	- views, triggers, procedures, functions
	- relationships
	- multiversion concurrency control 
	- sql:2008 datatypes
		- integer, numeric, boolean, char, varchar, date, interval, timestamp
	- native programming interface

- pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental C:\dvdrental.tar

- COPY actor TO 'C:\actor.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;

- list unique first name along with the count of occurrence from actor table
	SELECT first_name, COUNT(first_name)
	FROM Actor
	WHERE actor_id BETWEEN 100 and 200
	GROUP BY first_name

- to filter down grouped/aggregated result set, cannot use WHERE, must use HAVING
- list all the first names which occur more than 1 time
	SELECT first_name, COUNT(first_name)
	FROM Actor
	WHERE actor_id BETWEEN 100 and 200
	GROUP BY first_name
	HAVING COUNT(first_name) > 1

- e.g
	CREATE TABLE actor
	(
		actor_id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('actor_actor_id_seq'::regclass),
		first_name character varying(45) NOT NULL,
		last_name character varying(45) NOT NULL,
		last_update timestamp without time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
		CONSTRAINT actor_pkey PRIMARY KEY (actor_id)
	)
		- actor_id value generated from sequence every time a new row is inserted in the table
		- first_name and last_name are strings up to 45 char long
		- last_update has DEFAULT value now --> every time a record = inserted, this col is auto updated with current timestamp
		- actor_id and last_update are autopopulated
